description: End-to-end testing of implemented features with visual/functional validation
---

Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of the most recently implemented feature.

## Testing Approach

### Frontend Features
- **Visual Confirmation**: Take screenshots or use browser tools to verify UI components render correctly
- **Interaction Testing**: Test all user interactions (clicks, forms, navigation)
- **Responsive Design**: Verify mobile-first design works across different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Check keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

### Backend Features  
- **Input Validation**: Test with valid, invalid, and edge case inputs
- **Output Verification**: Confirm correct data format and content in responses
- **Error Handling**: Verify appropriate error messages and status codes
- **Integration Points**: Test API endpoints and database interactions

## Testing Process

1. **Identify the Feature**: Determine what was most recently implemented
2. **Create Test Scenarios**: Define happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
3. **Execute Tests**: Run through each scenario systematically
4. **Document Results**: Record what works, what doesn't, and any issues found
5. **Visual Evidence**: For frontend, provide screenshots or describe visual state
6. **Performance Check**: Note any performance issues or slow responses

## Deliverables

- Test execution summary
- List of issues found (if any)
- Visual confirmation for frontend features
- Input/output validation for backend features
- Recommendations for fixes or improvements
